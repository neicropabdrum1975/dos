## What’s a Research-Based Argument Essay?

A research-based argument essay is an academic paper in which you present a clear argument on a specific topic, while supporting your viewpoint with **credible research and evidence**. The goal is to persuade your readers by presenting well-supported claims and counterarguments, using data, facts, and examples to back up your position.

Here’s a quick breakdown of what makes a research-based argument essay stand out:

- **Clear Thesis Statement:** Your essay should have a strong thesis that clearly states your position on the topic.
- **In-Depth Research:** You need to include credible sources, such as scholarly articles, books, and research studies, to support your argument.
